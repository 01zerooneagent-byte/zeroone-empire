# 🐲 Smavg Dragon — Neural Pattern Encoder (NPE)
Smavg compresses large language models (up to 1B params) 100x smaller, 
retaining near-zero loss accuracy through Neural Pattern Encoding (NPE).
This is the Genesis build — v0.1 (Local Prototype).

Structure:
- models/       → Base + compressed model files
- encoder/      → Pattern extraction network
- decoder/      → Regeneration/inference engine
- data/         → Training & validation datasets
- scripts/      → Core pipelines (encode/decode)
- logs/         → System and test logs
- docs/         → Notes, benchmarks, papers
